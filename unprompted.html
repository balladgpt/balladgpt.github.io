            <h2>What is Unprompted Generation?</h2>
            <p>Unprompted generation is very simple: allowing the model to generate a ballad without a prompt.</p>
            <p><b>Warning:</b> Unprompted generation may generate content not suitable for all ages as this allows the AI to be more creative, generating somewhat random text.</p>
            <h2>How can I use Unprompted Generation?</h2>
            <p>To use unprompted generation, just leave the prompt blank:</p>
            <p>1. Install Transformers</p>
            <pre><code class="language-bash">pip3 install transformers</code></pre>
            <p>2. Download model from Hugging Face via Transformers and generate text</p>
            <pre><code class="language-python">from transformers import pipeline
generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='balladgpt/balladgpt-v2')
print(generator("", do_sample=True, min_length=20)[0]['generated_text'])</code></pre>
            <p>Running this code may generate an output such as:</p>
            <pre><code>Once upon a time to come
There was the great, wild bird of the night, the white-trucking-horse--
There were the wild-cock and the porter
To be followed by the wild-porter.
And then one at a time--
The wild-porter said: "My own, my merry-niece,
We are the wild-porter, no more!"
All together in the wild-porter's shadow we drew.
At the back of the barns the porter sang: "Bowl of the week, now it is true;
The fresh-grown corn is still brown, the green leaves are bright!
And in the woods of the winter wood,
The porter drew his straw up;
And the green-crested pine trees did not grow till
Until the week was past;
And when the new winter heat had returned,
The pine woods were turned pale,
And all day long the snow lay.
The farmer looked at the old-fashioned barns and spoke to her corn,
And heard the sweet and flower-like rustling sound of hay
With the growing winter-beat and clover-wind.
He heard the hoofs and the hay's gray tresses grow and the sun shine.
There was the rustling of the yellow-sweets, and the brightening of the yellow peonies
And the new spring began,
And at the old-fashioned barns, the hay in the summer heat
All grew.
So on the old barn, and at the old-fashioned barn windows
With old corn and blue-roofed leaves, the hay stood bright.
The sweet flowers bloomed with new flower-like songs,
And in the green-crested pine trees, the wood-porters and the hay,
The wood-porter laughed, "How sweet!"
And on the straw of the spring-fed hay-sawned, the white-trucking-horse sang,
The grass the wood with gold and rose,
The bread-porter's spake, the hag-dogs, the hay at her side,
And, with the corn in the summer's harvest's crook she sang,
"What is the harvest?" "The harvest grows and all
As fast as the hogs that have grown--
And all is grown as well as all is kept</code></pre>
