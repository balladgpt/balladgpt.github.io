To bring them good food and good wine</code></pre>

            <pre><code>As I come to you are dead;
Than I came so suddenly,
That you came to me were dead;
There I heard you hear your own voice,
When in my memory you came to me.
"I hear you hear your own voice,
When in my memory you came to me;
Because your hand is dead, your arms are dead,
My eyes are dead, my teeth are dead,
For my hair is dead, my beard is dead,
Your eyes have gone in agony,
And I weep for my death.</code></pre>
            <h2>BalladGPT V1 (Old)</h2>
            <p>This model is not recommended for production purposes.</p>

            <p>BalladGPT V1 was released on March 18, 2023. The outputs of BalladGPT V1 were highly skewed towards certain topics due to a skew in training data. BalladGPT V1 was primarily trained in 19th century ballads.</p>
